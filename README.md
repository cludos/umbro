## Structure
Board is script attached to a plane.
bool 2D array of cell keeps track of which tiles are lit and their contents.
There's a way to access the board state from other scripts and interact with it.

## TODO
1. Have Light source prefabs which emit light on scene.
3. Create light switches that communicate with light sources, which in turn modify the board state.
4. Create scenes for each level.
5. Link each scene together for level progression.
